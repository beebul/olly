			<p><b style="text-align: left;">About Me</b><br>In 2004, after completing a degree in Furniture design from Loughborough University in the UK, I spent a year designing and making my own furniture whilst mentoring A-Level students in 3D design at a secondary school.  It was from there, that I gained a VM role working for OKA in London.  Roles at Liberty and then latterly as lead visual for Harrods came before meeting my Australian wife in London.
			Subsequent emigration led me to a VM manager role with David Jones in Adelaide where I currently live with my family and two young children.</p>

				<h3>Visual Merchandising</h3>
				<p><b>Experience</b><br>I have over 10 years experience in the visual merchandising world working with and for companies such as Harrods, Liberty and David Jones as well as some of the most sought after brands found within the retail industry.  I have worked on small and large scale projects from initial conception to full installation and am used to working to extremely tight schedules in an ever changing environment.<br><br>
						My roles have seen me work throughout the UK and Australia for all type of retailers, covering individual stores, pop up ventures and large scale departments.
						In that time I have looked after a diverse range of products and styles from fashion and accessories through to homewares, furniture and food.</p>

				<p><b>Why visual merchandising and styling?</b><br>Visual merchandising has the power to inspire your customers and the innate ability to access all senses.  From multi-million dollar Christmas installations to boutique homeware vignettes all, fundamentally, have the same aspiration, to entertain, inspire and ultimately create sales.
